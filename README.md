# FoodConnect (Rookie Hacks)

# Inspiration
During this time it is especially important to ensure food security for those in need, this was the main inspiration for FoodConnect.

# What it does
FoodConnect connects Food banks to donors who have products they need. The donor submits the items they have and the app connects them to a FoodBank that needs those items.

# How I built it
We built it using Dart and the Flutter Framework. The great thing about a cross platform framework like Flutter is that the same codebase can be deployed to iOS and Android. The app also uses AutoML in order to identify the food.

# Challenges I ran into
Adding machine learning to the app and using the database was difficult because it was our first time.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Although we started late we managed to pull through and we're really happy about that.

# What I learned
We learned how to store information in external databases and integrate machine learning into our apps.

# What's next for FoodConnect
Next, we plan on adding more test cases so that the computer vision will be better and also adding authentication to our app.
